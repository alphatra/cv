# Active Context

## Current Focus

Fixing the internationalization (i18n) implementation for Polish (pl), Italian (it), and German (de) languages. The English (en) version is assumed to be working.

## Task

1.  **Investigate:** Determine why pl, it, de translations are not working. Check configuration, translation files, and language switching logic.
2.  **Research:** Explore Vercel's built-in i18n capabilities and assess if they can be leveraged.
3.  **Implement:** Apply the necessary fixes to enable the missing languages.
4.  **Document:** Update the Memory Bank with findings and changes.

## Considerations

-   Confirm the actual i18n library/method being used.
-   Verify the location and structure of translation files.
-   Ensure the Next.js configuration (e.g., `next.config.js`) correctly lists all required locales.
-   Check how language switching is implemented and if it correctly routes to locale-specific paths.
